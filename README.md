# Untitled Loop Game

Untitled Loop Game is a simple beat mixer that allows users to record/save short loops either using their keyboard or a midi controller.

#### Demo can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WAky_OSQxhWBg738-6XQ50Dxgq19pPsY)!

## How to Setup

Project does not come with sounds / midi.js. In order to setup the project you will have to install them into the loadMIDIPlayer.js file. The index.html will have to be run on a https server (we used live server with a **very** long delay on refresh), and the backend will have to be run on a ruby on rails server.

### MVP

[x] get midi.js working -> use live server pls

[x] 16 instruments

[x] midi loop over fixed time seconds

[x] keyboard interaction => assign focus to certain window for different instruments

[x] save loops / name loops / open loops

[x] looper visualization

[x] record add to form

[x] Recordings undo

### Stretch

[x] tempo - time/control (all things counting)

[x] key/sample duration -> look into sound engineering the VEL/VOL/DEL for each instrument

[x] CSS / material design for UX/UI?

[x] Update Control Panel to do more things (metronome / record)

[x] metronome

[x] instrument volume slider

[ ] Offline support

### Super Stretch

[x] MIDI SUPPORT!?!?
